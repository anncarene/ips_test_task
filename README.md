# ips_test_task
Intel Programming School 2022 testing task

The essence of the task is an implementation of a singly linked list that stores objects of any type.
It is necessary to implement the following:
  -a default constructor
  -a copy constructor
  -a getter for the first item in the list
  -a destructor
  -a copy assignment operator
  -a function for adding an item to the beginning
  -a function for removing an item from the end
  -a function for removing all the items equal to some value
  -a function for inverting the order of items in the list (example: {1, 2, 3, 4} -> {4, 3, 2, 1})
  -a swap function for two lists
